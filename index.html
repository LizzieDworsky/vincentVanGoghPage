                <strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong> was a Dutch Post-Impressionist
                painter who posthumously (after his death) became one of the
                most famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a
                decade,
                <em
                    >he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
                    paintings,</em
                >
                most of which date from the last two years of his life. They
                include landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits,
                and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive
                and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of
                modern art. He was not commercially successful and, struggling
                with severe depression and poverty, committed suicide at the age
                of 37.
