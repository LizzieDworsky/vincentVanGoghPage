                Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who
                posthumously became one of the most famous and influential
                figures in Western art history. In a decade, he created about
                2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of
                which date from the last two years of his life. They include
                landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, and are
                characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and
                expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of
                modern art. He was not commercially successful and, struggling
                with severe depression and poverty, committed suicide at the age
                of 37.
